    "If a threshold is 1, values higher than 1 mean that feature is informative about the target, but if there are multiple features with high MI values over 1, they may share a lot of information and may not add value to the model. Therefore if there is more than one feature with higher than 1, we may want to remove the feature that is less correlated to the target. On the other hand, if MI values are very low such as less than 0.5, it means that those features do not help the model to predict target, we are better off with removing them. For example, I see that Sgpt ans Sgot have relatively very low MI values on all their pairs, I would eliminate these two columns."

    "For this assignment, we assume that you are already familiar with the basics of Python. One of the Python libraries data scientists often use is `numpy`, which is a library that facilitates array computations, such as matrix algebra. What this means is that using numpy, we can manipulate vectors, matrices or any n-dimensional array mostly without the need to write loops, so the code is cleaner and more succinct. In this exercise, we want to learn the basics of `numpy` and `pandas`.\n",

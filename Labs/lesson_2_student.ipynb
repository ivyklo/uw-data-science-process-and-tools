    "# Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a coding assignment, but for the sake of consistency we use this Jupyter notebook to work on it and submit it. For this assignment you will watch a video of a data science professional talking about a use case. Of course not every step will be easy to follow, but as data scientists we should be able to look at some complicated process in a and relate them to other common patterns we observe across use cases. So the goal of the assignment is to do this for one of the use cases listed below.\n",

The Python fork [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) requires types to be explicit and correct or produces an error, and the data validation library [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) allows the creation of custom data classes with precisely type parameters. In standard Python, type hints tell the person viewing the code what type to expect and allows IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like JupyterLab or VSCode what methods to suggest for that variable."
